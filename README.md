# web-ledger

• Designed the front-end of a fully functional website that allowed an organisation to maintain all of its transactions under
a same application.
• Designed an interface that managed different group of employees with a different view and restricted functionalities in
the website.
• Added many functionalities like search bar, rendering PDF pages, drop-down, etc.
• Styled the website with trendy layouts and design to meet the market standards.

This website allows an organisation(specifically finance related firms) to keep track of all their employees as well as transactions associated with them. It allows superusers to 
run queries related to transactions. 
It allows different band of employees to access different level of functionalities. For example, the owner(superuser) can view and update each and every details related to any field(handle database), but the 
money collector(low-level employee) can just add amount and expenses.

You can visit the live hosted website here. [Web Ledger](http://webledger.herokuapp.com/).
